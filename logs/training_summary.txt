Model: YOLOv8 (Object Detection)
Task: Rooftop Solar Panel Detection from Satellite Imagery

Training Summary:
- Total epochs: 60
- Input image size: 640 x 640
- Classes: solar_panel
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Learning rate: default YOLOv8 settings

Performance:
- Best validation F1 score: 0.75
- Final RMSE for panel area estimation: 6.0 m²

Notes:
- Bounding-box detection is used (no segmentation).
- Each detection represents a solar panel array segment.
- Area estimation is derived from bounding box size and map scale.
- Model trained on mixed rooftop imagery with varied roof materials.

The final trained weights are saved as best.pt.
